# Project Roadmap: n8n Workflow Analysis System

## Project Goals

- [x] Implement template-based workflow analysis with OpenRouter API
- [x] Switch to Mistral AI model for improved analysis quality
- [x] Include node type information in analysis output
- [ ] Create a scalable system to process ~1500 n8n workflow URLs
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and cooling periods to avoid API restrictions
- [ ] Ensure proper output management to `/root/ai_n8n_workflowmaker/n8n_workflows`
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting for system health

## Key Features

### Completed Features

- [x] **Template-Based Analysis**
  - [x] Create templates for comprehensive workflow analysis
  - [x] Implement template loading and rendering
  - [x] Support for different analysis types (technical, business)

- [x] **Mistral AI Integration**
  - [x] Update configuration to use Mistral models
  - [x] Modify code to use model from settings
  - [x] Update documentation for model usage

- [x] **Enhanced Node Analysis**
  - [x] Include node type information in analysis
  - [x] Improve node description quality
  - [x] Ensure all nodes are covered in analysis

### Pending Features

- [ ] **URL Management System**
  - [ ] Sitemap.xml parser for workflow URLs
  - [ ] URL deduplication and tracking
  - [ ] Batch processing support

- [ ] **Rate Limiting and Cooling**
  - [ ] Implement token bucket rate limiter
  - [ ] Add jittered cooldown periods
  - [ ] Support for dynamic backoff

- [ ] **Output Management**
  - [ ] Directory structure enforcement
  - [ ] Workflow saving and organization
  - [ ] Error handling and logging

- [ ] **Monitoring and Alerting**
  - [ ] Track success/failure rates
  - [ ] Monitor processing latency
  - [ ] Implement alert thresholds

## Completion Criteria

1. System can process ~1500 n8n workflow URLs without hitting rate limits
2. All workflows are properly analyzed with the template system
3. Output is correctly saved to `/root/ai_n8n_workflowmaker/n8n_workflows`
4. Monitoring system provides visibility into processing status
5. Documentation is complete and up-to-date
