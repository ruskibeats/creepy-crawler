## ✅ Task Completed Successfully

### URL Deduplication and Tracking Implementation
- **Redis Integration**
  - Implemented Redis-backed storage for URL tracking
  - Using efficient Redis data structures:
    - Sorted sets for queue (priority and timestamp)
    - Sets for processing URLs (atomic operations)
    - Hashes for completed/failed URLs (with metadata)
  - Proper byte string handling for Redis compatibility

- **URL State Management**
  - Tracking URLs through different states:
    - Queued → Processing → Completed/Failed
  - Automatic deduplication across all states
  - Retry mechanism for failed URLs (max 3 attempts)
  - Proper cleanup of completed/failed URLs

- **System Integration**
  - Connected to existing workflow processor
  - API endpoint for monitoring and control
  - Real-time statistics and monitoring
  - Concurrent processing with 5 workers

### Testing Results
- ✓ URL deduplication working correctly
- ✓ State transitions functioning properly
- ✓ Redis operations successful
- ✓ Concurrent processing effective
- ✓ API endpoints responsive

### Next Project Task
## Rate Limiting and Cooling Implementation

### Objectives
- Implement token bucket rate limiter to control API request rates
  - Recently resolved `SameFileError` in `n8n_workflow_processor.py` by optimizing file handling in `create_output_folder` function
- Add jittered cooldown periods between batches to distribute requests
- Support dynamic backoff based on API response headers
- Integrate rate limiting with existing queue system
- Monitor and log rate limit usage for optimization

### Context
- Prevent API rate limit errors during batch processing
- Distribute requests evenly over time to avoid triggering cooldowns
- Adapt to API response headers for optimal performance
- Ensure system can handle varying API rate limits dynamically

Focus on implementing rate limiting and cooling periods to avoid API restrictions, following the recent successful resolution of file handling issues.
